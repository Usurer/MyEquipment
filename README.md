# MyEquipment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.1.

This project follows the monorepo structure - so for the actual projects go into the "projects" folder. Since these projects are added by `ng generate application` I'll call them applications from now on. This may be confusing though (

In the angular.json you can find the "projects" section and the "defaultProject" which is currently set to "WebClient", thus when you run `ng serve` from the MyEquipment root, you'll have the WebClient opened. The serve command allows passing a project name as a param: `ng serve <project> [options]` (https://angular.io/cli/serve).
